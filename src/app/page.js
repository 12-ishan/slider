<h2 className="title"><strong>Curriculum</strong></h2>
<p>At ISPP, we believe in a holistic approach to policy, design and management which is based on the five pillars of Skills (S), Political Economy (P), Ethics (E), Leadership (L), and Lifelong learning (L). We have integrated the SPELL framework in designing the curriculum and the overall learning environment at the institution. This is implemented through the courses, mini-courses, workshops and labs, and domains.</p>

<div className="curriculum">
	

<button className="accordion-main accordion-cus">Courses</button>
<div className="panel-main">
<button className="accordion">Critical Thinking</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>Critical thinking is the ability to evaluate an argument. An argument attempts to persuade someone that a claim is true by giving reasons. Arguments proliferate in scholarly, civic, and personal discourse. Participants of this course will learn the tools and language that philosophers, lawyers, and rhetoricians use to reflect on such questions. What makes for a good argument? Should I be persuaded? Will others be persuaded?</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">Design Thinking</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>Design has been defined variously as a â€˜User-led problem-solving processâ€™ or a â€˜Human-centred opportunity-resolution journeyâ€™. Design goes beyond aesthetics and is about evolution and progress; the underlying force behind creating compelling new things, new policies, new services, new brands, and even new business models. Design is about discovering what people really want or need and translating insights into great solutions. Design Thinking or User-Centered Innovation, is not the exclusive preserve of Designers. It is an approach that deploys a high degree of empathy and collaborative spirit to solve complex challenges and create ideas with enduring value. During the course, we will also select a public policy challenge and learn how to empathise with users, generate ideas to solve the problem, prioritise and select, and develop a prototype for the new solution.</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">Structures of Government</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>This course explores the intricacies of governmental structure. It has been designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how public systems are organised and function. Through engaging and interactive sessions, participants will delve into the various roles and the critical importance of government, the different forms it can take, and its organisational staffing. The course also covers the operational aspects of government in discharging its diverse functions, provides insights into key government personnel, and explores the roles of several significant government organisations. This course is essential for anyone looking to gain a deep and practical understanding of the mechanisms that drive public governance.</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">Business and Government</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>This course delves into the complex interplay between business and government. It has been designed to unravel the motivations behind government actions and offers a dual perspective on critical issues such as trade, environment, food security, and health from economic and political viewpoints. Scholars will learn to formulate and integrate an organisationâ€™s market and non-market strategies, understanding how these can be influenced by and how they can influence government policymaking. The curriculum covers various essential topics, including market failure, the problem of collective action, the roles of various governance systems, and the distinct dynamics of economic and political analyses. Participants will also examine the influence of interest groups like producers, consumers, associations, and unions, and understand how issues such as tariffs, environmental regulations, corporate bailouts, poverty, and education emerge and evolve in public discourse. This course equips scholars with the tools to anticipate policy changes and effectively shape policy outcomes, aligning organisational strategies with current and anticipated government policies.</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">Economics</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>Economics is the study of decision making under scarce resources, i.e., how economic entities decide on spending their resources to attain their economic objectives. Given scarce resources, these entities are limited in how much they can spend on any one activity, as whatever they spend on an activity is not available to be spent on another activity. This course will focus entirely on decisions made by individual entities like consumers and producers, both when faced with uncertainty and when not.</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">Economics of Public Policy</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>This course explores the profound impact of public policy on economic systems The objective is to familiarise scholars with the essentials of an economic system and how various public policy instruments influence it. Participants will delve into the basic concepts and analytical frameworks of Macroeconomics and Public Finance, providing a robust foundation for understanding fiscal and monetary policies. The course critically examines specific policy measures implemented in India, assessed through the conceptual lens introduced in the sessions. Additionally, scholars will engage with case studies that explore specific objectives and the practical application of public policies. This comprehensive approach ensures a deep and practical understanding of the economic implications of public policy, making it an essential course for those looking to navigate and influence economic policy effectively.</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">Game Theory</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>This course explores the strategic intricacies of human interaction. It has been designed to apply rigorous analytical techniques to various economic, social, political, business, and legal issues. Scholars will delve into key concepts such as backward induction, Nash equilibrium, the dynamic between self-interest and collective interest, the mechanisms of credible commitments, and both simultaneous and sequential games of complete and incomplete information. The course also covers repeated games and the application of game theory to economic development. Highlighting the work of several Nobel Laureates in Economics, the course showcases the profound impact of game theory from 1994 to 2017. By understanding gamesâ€”defined by their players, rules, strategies, information, and payoffsâ€”students will learn to predict outcomes and devise optimal strategies in scenarios ranging from cooperation and bargaining to auctions, pricing, and political competition, all crucial for navigating complex modern challenges in a variety of settings.</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">Law & Economics</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>The Law and Economics course is designed to make scholars understand the role of law in public policy for achieving social goals from an economist&rsquo;s viewpoint. Through the course, the scholars will understand the normative aspects of law and economics and the interplay between legal and economic principles. The course will also cover the law&rsquo;s role in generating social value through market-driven transactions. The course would look at various laws from an economic perspective, such as the economics of Private Property Law, Intellectual Property Law, Contract Law, and Tort Law. Along with this, the course will also cover the economic relevance of legal compensations, punishments, and regulations.</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">Management of Societies</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>Dive into the dynamic interplay of management, laws, and institutions in our course on the evolution of societal structures. This course starts by exploring how societies manage diverse interests through a mix of centralisation and decentralisation, which is crucial for thriving and defending against threats. We trace the historical ascent of legal systems and governance structures, from ancient kingships to modern democracies, focusing on case studies including the Maurya Empire, ancient Athens, and modern India. Leveraging game-theoretic reasoning and political philosophy, the course analyses the creation and evolution of laws and institutions based on the power dynamics of their proponents and opponents. Highlighting influential texts from Aristotle&rsquo;s Politics to Chanakya&rsquo;s Arthashastra and modern political analysis, the curriculum underscores the enduring relevance of the Great Books, providing a deep understanding of how democratic systems and institutional frameworks influence societal outcomes. This comprehensive approach fosters independent thinking and equips scholars with the analytical tools to evaluate and influence contemporary governance and policy issues.</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">Markets for Development</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>This course delves into the dynamics of policy tools focusing on &rdquo;Samaaj, Sarkaar, and Bazaar&rdquo; (Society, Government, and Market), where we explore the advantages and limitations of each. This course critically examines the common reliance on markets to address societal problems and the frequent occurrences of market failures. When markets falter, the typical shift is towards societal or governmental interventions. This course will teach you how these failures can be reinterpreted and markets redesigned to better fulfil their potential, particularly in serving marginalised communities and regions. We will investigate the &rdquo;Markets for the Poor&rdquo; (M4P) approach, demonstrating how markets can enhance or replace government services (M4G), sustainable management of natural resources (M4N), address market failures (M4F), and operate in traditionally non-market areas like organ transplants (M4U). Prepare to challenge conventional perspectives on markets, exploring concepts of missing, failing, undefendable, and empowering markets, and designing effective market-based solutions using the M4PUFNG approach (Markets for the Poor, Undefendables, (market) Failures, Natural Resources, and Government Goods and Services). This course promises to introduce radical ideas that will both shock and enlighten.</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">Politics of Public Policy</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>Public Policy is any action that affects the lives of citizens. However, the process is a complicated one which begins by developing an understanding of the context under which the situation emerged. Next, one needs to understand the reasons behind the issue gaining prominence and understanding the sources, tools, institutions, and people behind it. Thus, an interaction of various events, variables, resources, and other socio-economic and political factors follows. This is where the politics of public policy comes into play. It is both an art and a science that requires an astute understanding of the motivations of each actor and their possible actions and reactions. By navigating these complexities, policymakers can ensure that public policy decisions are informed and effective in improving the lives of citizens.</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">Statistics Part I</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>This course on Statistical Analysis for Policy Research is designed for scholars of public policy to develop an understanding of the importance of data and data analysis in policy formulation and research. It aims to develop statistical thinking among the learners and essential skills such as data summarisation, data presentation and visualisation, and model fitting for establishing causal relationships. The course aims to equip the learners with essential skills for sampling techniques, statistical inference, and hypothesis testing. It covers the practical tools of linear regression analysis by explaining the concepts of dependent, explanatory, and control variables. The course aims to develop a working knowledge of Microsoft Excel for day-to-day statistical policy research analysis.</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">Statistics Part II</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>This course on Statistical Analysis for Policy Research -II is designed for public policy scholars to understand the essential tools of statistical inference and establish causal relationships among the policy research variables. It begins with a discussion of one and two-way ANOVA, then moves on to explain the concept of multiple regression with emphasis on the essential condition of â€˜Cetris Paribasâ€™ with regard to multiple regression. It provides functional knowledge of three ways of conducting multiple regression analysis: simultaneous, sequential, and step-wise. It uses qualitative information such as â€˜Genderâ€™ in regression analysis, and qualitative dependent variables using a binary logistic regression model. It also introduces the concepts of path analysis and panel data modelling.</p>
</div>

<div className="curriculum">

	<button className="accordion-main accordion-cus">Mini-Courses</button>

<div className="panel-main">
<button className="accordion">Econometrics</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>Through a policy evaluation exercise, this mini-course will review the relevant concepts of probability and statistics (specifically, random sample, random variable, probability distribution function, conditional probability, and the expectation operator). The course will then study the statistical models often used to test theoretical economic relationships, analyse historical economic events, and evaluate policy. Simple and multiple regression using ordinary least squares will be covered in detail. The course will cover basic statistical inference and diagnostic tools for these models. Maximum likelihood and generalised least squares estimation techniques will be introduced. Time-allowing, the course will cover an introduction to the logistic regression model to handle discrete or qualitative choice variables (e.g., Yes/No choice scenarios) and basic time-series analyses.</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">Monitoring and Evaluation</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>Explore the fundamentals of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) in this mini-course, which is designed to enhance understanding of its role in complex development and policy-making environments. This course introduces participants to the entire M&E planning cycle, starting from the basics of monitoring and evaluation, their differences, and their significance in policy implementation, illustrated through case studies like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and the Bangladesh Second Urban Primary Health Care Project. Dive into the Theory of Change, Logical Framework, and SMART indicators, learning how to create robust M&E frameworks using government tools like India&rsquo;s Output-Outcome Monitoring Framework (OOMF). The course also covers advanced topics in data analysis, visualisation, and the use of the Data Governance and Quality Index, equipping students with practical skills in handling and interpreting data for insightful M&E. Sessions on evaluation delve into various methodsâ€”qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methodsâ€”and introduce essential concepts such as sampling, questionnaire development, and error types. Through hands-on exercises, participants will apply their learning to evaluate real-world programmes, gaining a deep, actionable understanding of M&E&rsquo;s pivotal role in effective governance and policy outcomes.</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">International Trade and Finance</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>Explore the complexities of global markets in this mini-course on International Trade and Finance. This course delves into the foundational theories of international trade, beginning with the Ricardian model of Comparative Advantage and expanding to encompass a broader understanding of trade dynamics and their welfare implications. We will examine trade policy instruments, including the economics of tariffs, quotas, and trade remedies, and the motivations behind protectionism within the political economy of trade policy. Additionally, the course covers essential aspects of International Finance, focusing on exchange rate determination and related financial topics. Through this comprehensive curriculum, participants will gain a nuanced understanding of how trade policies and international financial mechanisms influence global economic interactions and national welfare, preparing them to navigate and shape international economic relations effectively.</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">Voting and Democracy</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>This course introduces the complexities of democratic processes and its implications for democracy. It explores how democratic outcomes are shaped not only by voter preferences but also by the voting systems used, challenging the notion that democracy operates solely by the people&rsquo;s will. We examine scenarios where traditional majority rules fail to produce consistent results with more than two options, as Arrow&rsquo;s theorem states that no voting system is perfect. The course also considers the practical applications of voting in power distribution, checks and balances, and information aggregation, as seen in various global and local contexts, such as the European Union and jury decisions. Delve into the debate between liberalism and populism, guided by thinkers like James Madison and Rousseau, and explore how different interpretations affect the perceived legitimacy of electoral outcomes. We discuss how decision-making rules, strategic voting, and agenda control affect public policies and laws through a thorough analysis of electoral systems like plurality and proportional representation, as seen in the UK&rsquo;s electoral outcomes. This course extends foundational concepts like Condorcet&rsquo;s winner and Arrowâ€™s theorem to current debates on governance and public policy, offering a critical perspective on the democratic systemâ€™s ability to reflect the people&rsquo;s true will and its societal implications.</p>

<button className="accordion">What is the structure of the ISPP Postgraduate Programme in Public Policy, Design and Management?</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>ISPPâ€™s Postgraduate Programme integrates diverse dimensions of Public Policy Education with an up-to-date curriculum and training in line with the best policy programmes offered across the globe.</p>
<p>Capacity, flexibility and innovativeness are the three key factors in the design of our PG programme. We ensure you attend the right courses, clubbed with the ever-evolving practical knowledge sessions.</p>
<p>Offered as the finest combination of compulsory courses, workshops, labs and collaborative certificates, ISPP brings forth the best resource persons, policy veterans and field experts to deliver one of the most innovative curriculums to its scholars. Throughout your time at ISPP, we will work to align your skills and make you industry-ready from an employerâ€™s perspective.</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">What will be the ISPP Postgraduate Programme className Size?</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>ISPP is a growing institution working to provide premier policy education to all interested applicants. However, we are restricted by resources and are able to accommodate only a limited number of interested applicants.</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">Why is ISPP Postgraduate Programme offered as a one-year programme, and not as a two-year programme?</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>One-year duration of our Postgraduate Programme is what gives the ISPP education an edge over the traditional masterâ€™s degrees. In this one year of intensive training at ISPP, we cover all key aspects of policy education, including design thinking and management.</p>
<p>Compared to a conventional two-year masterâ€™s programme, ISPP scholars spend less time studying, enter their choice of career earlier, and spend higher time solving real world challenges. With that being said, it is important to note that the programme is rigorous, demanding and intensive for its scholars.</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">Is the ISPP Postgraduate Programme a residential programme?</button>
<div className="panel">
<p>No, the ISPP Postgraduate Programme is a non-residential programme. ISPP does not provide any residential facilities on its campus.</p>
<p>Since most ISPP scholars are outstation candidates, the ISPP Admissions Team assists them in finding accommodation by sharing recommendations, experiences from past scholars etc. However, ISPP does take any responsibility for the price, contract or quality of services provided by the residential facility that the scholars may choose. Each scholar shall sign an individual and independent contract with their agreed residential facility.</p>
<p>In case more than 10-15 scholars choose to stay in one residential facility or neighborhood, ISPP also provides a shuttle service to campus and back on nominal charges.</p>
</div>

<button className="accordion">Does ISPP provide placements and career support to its Postgraduate Programme scholars?</button>

Some of our scholars, who wished to pursue their studies further, are now at the best global universities such as Oxford University, Georgia Tech, and University of Amsterdam, with the support, guidance and recommendations from ISPPâ€™s prominent faculty members</p>
